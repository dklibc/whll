I think bootloader must be as simple as possible, and it is wrong (but 
convinient) to implement bootloader that knows how to load kernel from
file system. So the right way to load kernel is when bootloader and 
kernel are installed in separate disk partition that has no FS.

I think that bootloader shouldn't print long descriptive messages when 
error occurs or about at what stage it is. Why? Since long messages take 
a lot of bytes and bootloader doesn't fit into 512 bytes, so it will 
need to load the rest of its body... and this isn't gracefull. I think 
one letter/char is suffitient: in case of error user should get docs and 
decode what was happened.
